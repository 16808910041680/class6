        <h1>About</h1>
        <h3>Hi! This is an autobiography of Sam, the fictional Codingal character.</h3>
        <h4>
            Sam is a fictional character designed by Codingal to create absurdly weird stories on why we need to do our project for him. This has multiple flaws when presented with a child with personal opinions, but we'll get into that later. Anyways, our friend Sam here always asks the Codingal project completers to do their project for him, no matter how many favors we have given him. Eventually, I believe someone should tell him that coding services cost actual cash in this real world, and that Codingal should make more believable fictional characters, perhaps persuaded by this unimportant piece of post-formal text, but perhaps Codingal would also be forced to read this at some point, or at least one of it's staff. 
        </h4>

    <div id="section2" class="container-fluid">
        <h1>Details +  Personal Opinion</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Very Enthusiastic About Projects That Only Codingal, And Not Sam, Are Going To Recieve
                (Even Though Sam Is Technically A Creation Of Codingal)
            </li>
            <li>
                Quite Unpersuasive, Though We Still Do Our Projects Dilligently
            </li>
            <li>
                Loves To Constantly Ask For Favors (He Sould Learn Himself Through Codingal)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>
            Maybe this autobiography was all just an ad to Sam to join Codingal instead of pestering us for favors, and Sam, (you don't exist but whatever) if you are reading this, you should join Codingal though this <a href="https://www.codingal.com/referral/sadTuna86/invite/?referrer=Q3lydXM%3D&utm_source=invite&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=paid">affiliate link </a>and join a Codingal plan, so you can learn coding yourself. Even so, I still belive a change of character and scenery paired with a better, believable story should be in order. Perhaps you could hire one of your students to do you a favor, and write the stories for you. Like the dilligent coder in this situation, I'd be situated in a position perfect for the job. Then again,
